                [Phoebe discovered spinning.

        No. 1. When maiden loves, she sits and sighs
                  (INTRODUCTION and SONG)
                           Phoebe

PHOEBE              When maiden loves, she sits and sighs,
                       She wanders to and fro;
                  Unbidden tear-drops fill her eyes,
                  And to all questions she replies,
                       With a sad "Heigh-ho!"

                  'Tis but a little word—"Heigh-ho!"
                  So soft, 'tis scarcely heard—"Heigh-ho!"
                       An idle breath—
                       Yet life and death
                  May hang upon a maid's "Heigh-ho!"

                  When maiden loves, she mopes apart,
                       As owl mopes on a tree;
                  Although she keenly feels the smart,
                  She cannot tell what ails her heart,
                       With its sad "Ah, me!"

                  'Tis but a foolish sigh—"Ah, me!"
                  Born but to droop and die—"Ah, me!"
                       Yet all the sense
                       Of eloquence
                  Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"

                       Yet all the sense
                       Of eloquence
                  Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"
                       "Ah, me!", "Ah, me!"

                       Yet all the sense
                       Of eloquence
                  Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"

   [PHOEBE weeps

   [Enter WILFRED

WILFRED   Mistress Meryll!

PHOEBE    [looking up] Eh! Oh! it's you, is it? You may go
        away,if you like. Because I don't want you, you know.

WILFRED   Haven't you anything to say to me?

PHOEBE    Oh yes! Are the birds all caged? The wild beasts all
        littered down? All the locks, chains, bolts, and bars
        in good order? Is the Little Ease sufficiently
        comfortable? The racks, pincers, and thumbscrews all
        ready for work? Ugh! you brute!

WILFRED   These allusions to my professional duties are in
        doubtful taste. I didn't become a head-jailer because
        I like head-jailing. I didn't become an assistant-
        tormentor because I like assistant-tormenting. We
        can't all be sorcerers, you know. [PHOEBE is annoyed]
        Ah! you brought that upon yourself.

PHOEBE    Colonel Fairfax is not a sorcerer. He's a man of
        science and an alchemist.

WILFRED   Well, whatever he is, he won't be one for long, for
        he's to be beheaded to-day for dealings with the
        devil. His master nearly had him last night, when the
        fire broke out in the Beauchamp [pronounced Bee'cham]
        Tower.

PHOEBE    Oh! how I wish he had escaped in the confusion! But
        take care; there's still time for a reply to his
        petition for mercy.

WILFRED   Ah! I'm content to chance that. This evening at half-
        past seven— ah! [Gesture of chopping off a head.]

PHOEBE    You're a cruel monster to speak so unfeelingly of the
        death of a young and handsome soldier.

WILFRED   Young and handsome! How do you know he's young and
        handsome?

PHOEBE    Because I've seen him every day for weeks past taking
        his exercise on the Beauchamp [pronounced Bee'cham]
        Tower.

WILFRED   Curse him!

PHOEBE    There, I believe you're jealous of him, now. Jealous
        of a man I've never spoken to! Jealous of a poor soul
        who's to die in an hour!

WILFRED   I am! I'm jealous of everybody and everything. I'm
        jealous of the very words I speak to you— because they
        reach your ears— and I mustn't go near 'em!

PHOEBE    How unjust you are! Jealous of the words you speak to
        me! Why, you know as well as I do that I don't even
        like them.

WILFRED   You used to like 'em.

PHOEBE    I used to pretend I like them. It was mere politeness
        to comparative strangers.

        [Exit PHOEBE, with spinning wheel

WILFRED   I don't believe you know what jealousy is! I don't
        believe you know how it eats into a man's heart— and
        disorders his digestion— and turns his interior into
        boiling lead. Oh, you are a heartless jade to trifle
        with the delicate organization of the human interior.

               No. 1A. When jealous torments
                      (OPTIONAL SONG)
                          Wilfred

WILFRED        When jealous torments rack my soul,
                  My agonies I can't control,
             Oh, better sit on red hot coal
                  Than love a heartless jade.

             The red hot coal will hurt no doubt,
                  But red hot coals in time die out,
             But jealousy you can not rout,
                  Its fires will never fade.

             It's much less painful on the whole
                  To go and sit on red hot coal
             'Til you're completely flayed,
             Or ask a kindly friend to crack
                  Your wretched bones upon the rack
             Than love a heartless jade,
                  Than love a heartless jade.

             The kerchief on your neck of snow
                  I look on as a deadly foe,
             It goeth where I dare not go
                  And stops there all day long.

             The belt that holds you in its grasp
                  Is to my peace of mind a rasp,
             It claspeth what I can not clasp,
                  Correct me if I'm wrong.

             It's much less painful on the whole
                  To go and sit on red hot coal
             'Til you're completely flayed,
             Or ask a kindly friend to crack
                  Your wretched bones upon the rack
             Than love a heartless jade,
                  Than love a heartless jade.

             The bird that breakfasts on your lip,
                  I would I had him in my grip,
             He sippeth where I dare not sip,
                  I can't get over that.

             The cat you fondle soft and sly,
                  He layeth where I dare not lie.
             We're not on terms, that cat and I.
                  I do not like that cat.

             It's much less painful on the whole
                  To go and sit on red hot coal
             'Til you're completely flayed,
             Or ask a kindly friend to crack
                  Your wretched bones upon the rack
             Than love a heartless jade,
                  Than love a heartless jade.

             Or ask a kindly friend to crack
                  Your wretched bones upon the rack
             Than love a heartless jade.
