<h6>PHOEBE</h6>      <pre><p>When maiden loves, she sits and sighs,
                       She wanders to and fro;
                  Unbidden tear-drops fill her eyes,
                  And to all questions she replies,
                       With a sad "Heigh-ho!"

                  'Tis but a little word—"Heigh-ho!"
                  So soft, 'tis scarcely heard—"Heigh-ho!"
                       An idle breath—
                       Yet life and death
                  May hang upon a maid's "Heigh-ho!"

                  When maiden loves, she mopes apart,
                       As owl mopes on a tree;
                  Although she keenly feels the smart,
                  She cannot tell what ails her heart,
                       With its sad "Ah, me!"

                  'Tis but a foolish sigh—"Ah, me!"
                  Born but to droop and die—"Ah, me!"
                       Yet all the sense
                       Of eloquence
                  Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"

                       Yet all the sense
                       Of eloquence
                  Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"
                       "Ah, me!", "Ah, me!"

                       Yet all the sense
                       Of eloquence
                  Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"</p></pre>

   <p>[PHOEBE weeps]</p>

   <p>[Enter WILFRED]</p>

<h6>WILFRED</h6>   <p>Mistress Meryll!</p>

<h6>PHOEBE</h6>   <p> [looking up]</p><p> Eh! Oh! it's you, is it? You may go
        away,if you like. Because I don't want you, you know.</p>

<h6>WILFRED</h6>   <p>Haven't you anything to say to me?</p>

<h6>PHOEBE</h6>    <p>Oh yes! Are the birds all caged? The wild beasts all
        littered down? All the locks, chains, bolts, and bars
        in good order? Is the Little Ease sufficiently
        comfortable? The racks, pincers, and thumbscrews all
        ready for work? Ugh! you brute!</p>

<h6>WILFRED</h6>   <p>These allusions to my professional duties are in
        doubtful taste. I didn't become a head-jailer because
        I like head-jailing. I didn't become an assistant-
        tormentor because I like assistant-tormenting. We
        can't all be sorcerers, you know. <p>[PHOEBE is annoyed]</p>
        Ah! you brought that upon yourself.</p>

<h6>PHOEBE</h6>    <p>Colonel Fairfax is not a sorcerer. He's a man of
        science and an alchemist.</p>

<h6>WILFRED</h6>   <p>Well, whatever he is, he won't be one for long, for
        he's to be beheaded to-day for dealings with the
        devil. His master nearly had him last night, when the
        fire broke out in the Beauchamp <p>[pronounced Bee'cham]</p>
        Tower.</p>
