<p class = "song">When maiden loves, she sits and sighs,
                       She wanders to and fro;
                  Unbidden tear-drops fill her eyes,
                  And to all questions she replies,
                       With a sad "Heigh-ho!"

                  'Tis but a little word—"Heigh-ho!"
                  So soft, 'tis scarcely heard—"Heigh-ho!"
                       An idle breath—
                       Yet life and death
                  May hang upon a maid's "Heigh-ho!"

                  When maiden loves, she mopes apart,
                       As owl mopes on a tree;
                  Although she keenly feels the smart,
                  She cannot tell what ails her heart,
                       With its sad "Ah, me!"

                  'Tis but a foolish sigh—"Ah, me!"
                  Born but to droop and die—"Ah, me!"
                       Yet all the sense
                       Of eloquence
                  Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"

                       Yet all the sense
                       Of eloquence
                  Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"
                       "Ah, me!", "Ah, me!"

                       Yet all the sense
                       Of eloquence
                  Lies hidden in a maid's "Ah, me!"</p></pre>
